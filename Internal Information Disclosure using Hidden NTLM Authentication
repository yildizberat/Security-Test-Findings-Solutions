Once an NTLM challenge is returned in the “WWW-Authenticate” value of the response headers, it can be decoded to capture internal information. 
I use Burp’s NTLM Challenge Decoder. or we can use nmap:

root@kali: nmap -sS -v --script=*-ntlm-info --script-timeout=60s example.com 
Nmap scan report for x.x.x.x 
Host is up (0.0063s latency). 
Not shown: 998 filtered ports 
PORT STATE SERVICE 
80/tcp open http 
| http-ntlm-info:

| NetBIOS_Computer_Name: IIS01 
| DNS_Domain_Name: IIS01 
| DNS_Computer_Name: IIS01 
|_ Product_Version: 6.3.9600




The recommended remediation for this vulnerability is to disable NTLM authentication over HTTP in the IIS Manager. 
Restricting public access to the ports utilizing Windows Authentication is another approach to containing the exposure and will help to prevent 
brute-force attacks against the service.
