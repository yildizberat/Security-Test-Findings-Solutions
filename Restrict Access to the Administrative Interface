In your .htaccess file, after the lines:
---	
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
---
Add this:
---	
<Files adminpage.php>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from <YOUR IP>
</Files>
---
An Example using the IP address I showed earlier:
---
<Files adminpage.php>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 198.168.1.39
</Files>
---
UPDATE

I have noticed that some of the Spam bots will try to POST directly to xmlrpc.php. The way to combat this is to add it to the same FILES directive above:
--- 
<Files adminpage\.php | xmlrpc\.php>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 198.168.1.39
</Files>
